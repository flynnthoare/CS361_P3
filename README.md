# Project 3: Turing Machine Simulator

## Overview

This program simulates a bi-infinite Turing Machine. It reads a machine encoding and input string from a file, then simulates how the TM processes the input according to its transition rules. The goal is to accurately and efficiently model TM behavior.

## Reflection
### Flynn
This project was a change of pace with no starter files to go off of. The project as a whole made sense after some thinking, and wasn't too difficult. The part I struggled with most was understanding the input. I got a bit stuck with the way that the input files were structured and understanding how everything needed to be parsed. I enjoyed this project in particular as it was more complicated and pushed my thinking a bit more than the others.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
javac tm/*.java
```
To run the program with a test input file use:
```
java tm.TMSimulator <input txt file>
```
User input required
